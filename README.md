### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This GitHub repository functions as an archival space to document my personal and academic progression as a PhD candidate in the domain of Canadian Indigenous Pedagogy. My professional background as a former English Instructor at the University of Ovor Mongolia has prepared me for this doctoral program, while concurrently propelling me towards the study and integration of Indigenous epistemologies into the modern educational system. I intend to critically explore the ways in which Indigenous pedagogies can be fused with Western academic frameworks, in order to create a more inclusive and comprehensive approach to education that benefits both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. Through this repository, I seek to chronicle my ongoing research journey, as well as offer insights into the methods and practices that I am employing towards this academic pursuit.
